**Coffee Inc. opened for business on January 1, 2016. The company has managed to stay afloat in the competitive coffee and tea beverage industry for two years. Management is ready to assess its performance over the years 2016 and 2017 in order to anticipate what tactical plans should be made for each product type it sells to continue the company’s growth. They have hired you to assist them with this analysis.**
***The task is to create visualzations using Tableau***
****The first step is to create a symbol map that takes the average margin of each market****
Highest Average Margins
Central - Colorado
West - California
East - New York
South - Texas
Lowest Average Margins
Central - Missouri
West - Utah
East - New Hampshire
South - New Mexico
Based on the initial analysis of Coffee Inc., I would recommend that they try to stick to a margin above 100. This would not only help even things out across the board but increase growth in underperforming markets. As far as the highest and lowest margins, they can keep the highest margin and ramp up the lowest margins to reach that 100. If they have margins at 100, they would be able to keep that consistency across the board.

****Next I created a horizontal bar chart in order to forecast Sales, Cogs, Margin, and Profit for each Product Type****
Coffee Inc. is the best at forecasting Margin for Espresso. I found this out by looking at the produced chart and seeing that the reference line is closest to the orange (espresso) in the Margin box. Margin is 121,172 and Budgeted Margin is 122,680, making for the closest forecast.
Coffee Inc. is the worst at forecasting Sales for Tea. I found this out by looking at the produced chart and seeing that the reference line is farthest from the green (tea) in the Sales box. Sales are 172,773 and Budgeted Sales is 133,600, making for the farthest forecast.
Under Forecasting Sales in my opinion matters most for success because it is always good that they sold more than they thought. If they over forecasted, then they’d have a problem and probably lose a lot of money.

****Comparing Inventory and Sales will help to see how fast inventory is moving****
Coffee Inc. has a lot less sales than they do inventory. They are not moving inventory that well. 
Adding a date factor to the scatter plot helps to visualize that sales have increased year over year. Their only problem would be too much inventory vs sales.

****Comparing Projected Profit and Actual Profit will help Coffee Inc. to see how well they are doing****
Upon further analyzing Coffee Inc., their Budgeted profit overall seems to decline from product to product. Using a bar chart helps to discriminate budgeted profit vs profit and adds different product types to the chart. It is important to have this insight because companies create profit goals and if they are not reaching them, they must have some sort of problem that needs to be analyzed.
